# Networking Manager

This is my attempt to create a networking manager without the use of a third party dependency such as Alamofire, SwiftyJSON etc.

This is build from the Networking chapter in the book Swift for Good by Paul Hudson and co. Absolutely recommended for anyone who wants to take their Swift/iOS skills to the next level.

Feedback are welcome.
